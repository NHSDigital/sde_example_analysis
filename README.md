## Description

The NHS England SDE is a data and research analysis platform, which is built to uphold the highest standards of privacy and security of NHS health and social care data when used for research and analysis.

Within the SDE, users have access to [Databricks](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/secure-data-environment-service/secure-data-environment/user-guides/using-databricks-in-sde). Some users may be new to Databricks, so we provide example notebooks and useful functions for what they can do with Databricks inside the SDE. In addition, the analysis explores machine learning (ML) capabilities in the SDE.

### Available analysis

#### :snake: python

pyspark_code_example: PySpark is the Python API for Aparche Spark - it can handle Big Data better than pandas.

##### :sparkles: machine_learning_big_data

Usually, if a dataframe has more than one million rows, it is big data. However, a dataset may have less rows than this and still be classed as "big" due to complexity.

This folder contains notebooks exploring the machine learning capabilities of PySpark in the SDE. Examples include:
- decision_tree_regressor
- random_forest_classifier

##### :panda_face: machine_learning_small_data

This folder contains analysis for smaller data sets, using libraries like pandas and sklearn. Examples include:
- regression_multivariable
- regression_simple

#### :pirate_flag:	r

SparkR is an R package that provides a light-weight frontend to use Apache Spark from R. The example notebook demonstrates what you can do with SparkR.

#### :mechanic: wrangler_utilities

Useful functions and code, including code to create and save toy data sets.
